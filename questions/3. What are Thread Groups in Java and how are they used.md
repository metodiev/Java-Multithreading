## Explanation

A Thread Group is a way to group multiple threads together.
It allows you to manage threads as a single unit, for example:

Interrupt all threads in the group.

Set uncaught exception handlers for the group.

Enumerate threads for monitoring purposes.

Key Points:

Every thread belongs to exactly one ThreadGroup.

Thread groups can be nested (parent-child hierarchy).

Each thread group can have a max priority, limiting the threadsâ€™ priorities inside the group.

Thread groups are largely legacy, replaced in modern code by ExecutorService and other concurrency utilities.

## Important Methods of ThreadGroup:

| Method                          | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| activeCount()                   | Number of active threads in the group.                   |
| enumerate(Thread[] tarray)      | Copy references of active threads into an array.         |
| interrupt()                     | Interrupt all threads in the group.                      |
| setMaxPriority(int)             | Sets maximum allowed priority for threads in this group. |
| uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable e) | Handles uncaught exceptions from threads in this group.  |


```java
public class ThreadGroupExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Create a thread group
        ThreadGroup group = new ThreadGroup("MyThreadGroup");

        // Thread 1 in the group
        Thread t1 = new Thread(group, () -> {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " running");
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
        }, "Thread-1");

        // Thread 2 in the group
        Thread t2 = new Thread(group, () -> {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " running");
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
        }, "Thread-2");

        // Start threads
        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        // Print active thread count
        System.out.println("Active threads in group: " + group.activeCount());

        // Enumerate threads in the group
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[group.activeCount()];
        group.enumerate(threads);
        for (Thread t : threads) {
            System.out.println("Thread in group: " + t.getName());
        }

        // Interrupt all threads in the group
        group.interrupt();
    }
}

# Explanation

## Concept of Condition Variables
- A condition variable allows a thread to wait until a specific condition is true.
- Always associated with a Lock (like ReentrantLock). Unlike Object.wait(), it is not tied to synchronized blocks.
- Commonly used in producer-consumer patterns, signaling between threads, or any scenario where one thread must wait for another.

## await()

- Called by a thread to release the lock and suspend execution until signaled.
- The thread automatically re-acquires the lock when resuming.
- Must be called within a lock; otherwise, IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown.

## signal() / signalAll()
- signal() wakes one waiting thread.
- signalAll() wakes all waiting threads.
- Must also be called within a lock.

## Best Practices

- Always check conditions in a loop, not with if, to handle spurious wakeups.
- Use signalAll() if multiple threads may need to proceed.
- Condition variables combined with Lock allow finer-grained control than synchronized.

## Why it improves concurrency

- Threads sleep efficiently rather than busy-waiting.
- Multiple threads can wait on the same condition safely.
- Reduces contention and improves throughput in multi-threaded applications.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.*;

public class ConditionExample {
    private static final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private static final Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
    private static boolean ready = false;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread waiter = new Thread(() -> {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                while (!ready) {
                    System.out.println("Waiter: waiting for condition...");
                    condition.await(); // waits until signaled
                }
                System.out.println("Waiter: condition met, proceeding");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        });

        Thread signaler = new Thread(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
            lock.lock();
            try {
                ready = true;
                System.out.println("Signaler: signaling condition");
                condition.signal(); // wakes one waiting thread
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        });

        waiter.start();
        signaler.start();

        waiter.join();
        signaler.join();
    }
}

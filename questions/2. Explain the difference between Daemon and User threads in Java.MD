## Why this matters

Architects must know which threads keep the JVM alive, which affects service shutdown, background tasks, and resource cleanup.

## Key Concepts

User thread: Keeps JVM alive until all user threads finish. <br>
Daemon thread: JVM exits when only daemon threads are remaining.<br>
Setting daemon: thread.setDaemon(true) (before start()). <br>
Common usage: Background monitoring, timers, cleanup threads.<br>

```bash

[*] --> JVM_RUNNING
JVM_RUNNING --> USER_THREADS_RUNNING: user threads active
JVM_RUNNING --> ONLY_DAEMON_THREADS: all user threads finished
ONLY_DAEMON_THREADS --> JVM_EXIT: JVM terminates
```

### Architect Insights

- Daemon threads should not manage critical resources (may exit abruptly). <br>
- Often used for logging, caching, or monitoring threads.<br>
- Be careful with libraries that create daemon threads internally.<br>

## Example Code

```java
public class DaemonThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Daemon running...");
                try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            }
        });
        t.setDaemon(true);
        t.start();
        System.out.println("Main thread exiting");
    }
}


```
Output: JVM exits immediately after main thread, daemon thread stops abruptly.

```java
public class DaemonExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

        Thread userThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                System.out.println("User thread started");
                Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate work
                System.out.println("User thread finished");
            } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
        }, "UserThread");

        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                while (true) {
                    System.out.println("Daemon thread running...");
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
        }, "DaemonThread");

        // Set daemon before starting
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);

        userThread.start();
        daemonThread.start();

        userThread.join();
        Thread.sleep(4000);
        System.out.println("Deamon thread after sleep " + daemonThread.getState());
        System.out.println("Main thread exits; daemon will stop if running");
    }
}

```

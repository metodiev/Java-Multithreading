# Detailed Explanation

## wait()

### Belongs to Object class.

- Must be called inside a synchronized block (holding the monitor).
- Releases the lock while waiting, allowing other threads to acquire the lock.
- Can be notified by notify() or notifyAll() to resume execution.
- Commonly used for thread coordination, e.g., producer-consumer.

## sleep()

- Belongs to Thread class.
- Does not release any locks; the thread simply pauses for a specified time.
- Used for delays or pacing, not coordination.
- Cannot be interrupted except via InterruptedException.

## Key Differences

| Feature              | wait()                 | sleep()             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Class                | Object                 | Thread              |
| Lock Release         | Releases monitor lock  | Holds lock          |
| Need Synchronization | Yes, must be in synchronized | No                  |
| Resume               | notify() / notifyAll() | Time expires or interrupted |
| Purpose              | Coordination / signaling | Delay / sleep       |

## Best Practices

- Use wait() only for coordination between threads.
- Use sleep() for pausing execution without affecting locks.
- Never mix wait() and sleep() for the same purposeâ€”they serve different concurrency goals.

```java
public class WaitVsSleepDemo {
    private static final Object lock = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Example of wait()
        Thread waiter = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock) {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Waiter: calling wait(), releases lock");
                    lock.wait(); // releases lock
                    System.out.println("Waiter: resumed after notify");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        });

        // Example of sleep()
        Thread sleeper = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock) {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Sleeper: calling sleep(), lock held");
                    Thread.sleep(2000); // lock is NOT released
                    System.out.println("Sleeper: finished sleeping");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        });

        waiter.start();
        Thread.sleep(500); // ensure waiter starts first
        sleeper.start();

        Thread.sleep(1000);
        synchronized (lock) {
            System.out.println("Main thread: calling notify()");
            lock.notify(); // wakes waiter
        }

        waiter.join();
        sleeper.join();
    }
}

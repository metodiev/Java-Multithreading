# Java Multithreading for Architects and Technical Leads

This repository contains a comprehensive set of questions designed for mastering **Java Multithreading** at the **Architect / Technical Lead** level.  
The sections are categorized to cover **fundamentals, advanced concepts, real-world scenarios, and leadership responsibilities**.



##  Category Breakdown

### 1. Thread Fundamentals 
- Thread lifecycle, states, priorities

- Creating threads (Thread, Runnable, Callable)  
- Handling interrupts and stopping threads safely  



### 2. Synchronization and Locks 
- synchronized keyword and monitor internals  
- Intrinsic locks vs. explicit locks  
- ReentrantLock and fairness policies  
- ReadWriteLock, StampedLock  
- Condition variables and signaling  



### 3. Java Memory Model 
- Happens-before relationships  
- volatile keyword semantics  
- Atomicity, visibility, ordering guarantees  
- Instruction reordering and fences  
- Final-field semantics in concurrency  



### 4. Concurrency Utilities 
- ExecutorService, thread pools  
- Work stealing and ForkJoinPool  
- CompletableFuture for async workflows  
- Blocking queues (ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue)  
- Countdown latches, cyclic barriers, phasers  
- Rate limiters and scheduled tasks  


### 5. Atomic Operations and Lock-Free 
- CAS (Compare-And-Swap) mechanics  
- AtomicInteger, AtomicReference, AtomicStampedReference  
- LongAdder, DoubleAdder for high-concurrency counters  
- Lock-free queues and stacks  
- ABA problem and solutions  
- VarHandles introduction  



### 6. Concurrent Collections 
- ConcurrentHashMap internals and segmenting  
- CopyOnWriteArrayList and when to use it  
- Concurrent skip list maps and sets  
- Weakly consistent iterators  
- Trade-offs vs. synchronized collections  



### 7. Concurrency Patterns 
- Producer-Consumer  
- Reader-Writer  
- Fork/Join divide-and-conquer  
- Actor model  
- Immutability in concurrency  
- Event-driven pipelines  
- Reactive streams  


### 8. Performance and Debugging 
- Deadlock detection and prevention strategies  
- Contention analysis and thread profiling  
- Thread dumps and analyzing blocked threads  
- Flame graphs for CPU and lock contention  
- Starvation and fairness  
- Scalability and throughput testing  



### 9. Reactive and Modern Approaches 
- Parallel streams vs. manual multithreading  
- Reactive programming (Reactor, RxJava)  
- Async IO vs. thread-per-request  
- Project Loom and virtual threads  
- Structured concurrency concepts  


### 10. System Design Scenarios 
- Architecting high-throughput data pipelines  
- Thread-per-request vs. async event loop models  
- Batch processing vs. streaming with concurrency  
- CQRS + concurrency  
- Resilient design with retries, timeouts, circuit breakers  
- Distributed locking strategies (e.g., Zookeeper, Redis)  


### 11. Leadership and Review Skills
